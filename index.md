### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 Part 1, "Filtering a Vector," is a favorite of mine. The reason why I enjoyed this lab is that it allowed me to explore the power and flexibility of vectors in programming. In this lab, we were asked to write a program that filters a vector based on certain criteria.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 Part 2, "Date difference," is a favorite of mine. The reason why I liked this lab is that it challenged me to think more deeply about the concept of time and how to represent it in code. In this lab, we were asked to write a program that calculates the difference between two dates in days, using an algorithm or function.

* Lab 8 

    Lab 8 Part 2, "Checking If a Number is Prime," is one of my favorites. The reason I like this lab is because it was challenging yet rewarding to complete. It allowed me to deepen my understanding of algorithms. I learned from this lab is that prime numbers have some interesting properties, such as the fact that they can only be divided by 1 and themselves. I also learned that checking if a number is prime can be a computationally intensive task, especially for very large numbers, and there are more efficient algorithms that can be used for this purpose.
