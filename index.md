### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 Part 1, "Filtering a Vector," is a favorite of mine. The reason why I enjoyed this lab is that it allowed me to explore the power and flexibility of vectors in programming. In this lab, we were asked to write a program that filters a vector based on certain criteria.
